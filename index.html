        <p>Farewell mierda mondays 👋
        Hello to Motivation Monday 🤝</p>
    <p>Thank you all who participated in Motivational Monday and welcomed it with open arms. I’m not sure if my frontal lobe is developing but I was thinking about this type of effect I want to leave on this world and I have a lot more to offer than just being funny & nasty. With that being said I hope this Monday’s motivation will last you guys until next week.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday guys. Remember if you have a vision or goal of any kind it is possible no matter how small or grandiose. Everything man ever created came out of a sheer thought (Electricity, cars, music, buildings, planes) all sheer thoughts at one point those people just believed they could do it. 
    </p>
    <p>With that being said don’t get in your own way and win the week boys. Much love.

    <p>‘The man who says he can, and the man who says he can not.. Are both correct' - Confucius
    </p>
    <p>One more thing for the religious folks. In the bible it says we were made from God’s image and likeness and if God is the creator of all things what does that make us ☝

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday you must wake up everyday and aim to beat your mind. I personally slip up and don’t execute every day but I’m learning to listen to that weak voice and beat it.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday fellas. Starting off it with one of my favorite figures.</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: Consistency with work ✅
    </p>
    <p>Great things take time. Detach from the end result and just aim to be a little better than the day before.

    <p>Theme of the week: delusional self belief. It all starts in the mind if you can start there and work consistently, results are sure to follow. It’s one of the universal laws.
    </p>
    <p>Law of cause and effect: every action has a corresponding consequence.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday. Make sure to be grateful. It can be easy to get caught up in the first world problems and make our own problems.
    </p>
    <p>Nonetheless we’re all truly blessed.

    <p>God bless you guys ☝

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday. Remember, you’re capable of more than you think. There’s two voices in your head; one that tells you that’s enough and the other that says I have more gas in the tank. 
    </p>
    <p>Water the side that says there’s more in the tank and annihilate the one that says that’s enough 🎯.

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday ☝</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: Life may beat your ass sometimes. But if you have the option to change something, take action to change it.
    </p>
    <p>The moment you believe the world’s out to get you is the moment where you lose your power. The most powerful thing we have is the ability to change. The ability to control our destiny 🛣🙏

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday 🙏</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: Stick with it 🔑</p>
    <p>In life when you’re trying to succeed there will be so many things that will make you want to throw in the towel (setbacks, doubt, losing. Relationships, anxiety, not seeing progress immediately). Things that would cause most people to quit. That’s why greatness is far and few.
    </p>
    <p>If you really want something you have to be so grounded in your self belief that you’ll look at those ‘setbacks’ as part of chasing greatness. I challenge all of you this week to seek excellence in everything you do.

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday ☝
    </p>
    <p>Theme of the week: You can do anything you put your mind to 🧠
    </p>
    <p>Things such as self talk, limiting beliefs, constantly focusing on your struggles or shortcoming instead of your progress & potential can make it seem as if you’re a lot smaller than you are -> (Not to say we can’t learn a lot from mistakes but do not dwell on it)
    </p>
    <p>Most of our subconscious beliefs are instilled into us from the outside (someone else) at an early age and we eventually internalize them and believe them.

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday📈</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: Losses🎯</p>
    <p>Learning how to overcome losses is essential in any endeavor. Losses can be looked at as failures or it can be looked at as a way to learn, grow, and persist.
    </p>
    <p>You either let losses crush you or you take the L and become a better you. Use the frustration as the fuel to keep going and prove to yourself you won’t give up.
    </p>
    <p>No one that’s done something great hasn’t taken a loss at one point or another so don’t look at losses like the end all be all. Look at losses as a regular part of the journey.

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: This Too Shall Pass🎯</p>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever and life is like a wave. When good times are around make sure you are thankful and enjoy them and when hard times come about know they won’t last forever. See what you can learn from the hard times.</p>

    <p>Theme of the week: Focus🎯</p>
    <p>
    We live in a world full of distractions. We’ve all probably heard the phrase, ‘Attention is the new currency.’ Regardless of what you focus on, make sure you give what you’re doing your fully undivided attention to become great at it.
    </p>
    <p>As the world becomes distracted, the focused man will always surpass the average joe.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday</p>
    <p>Quote of the week: Do what you hate to do🎯</p>
    <p>In life I’ve always been big on doing what most won’t, then eventually getting what most can’t. Discipline is not just something you wake up with one day. Motivation takes weeks and months until doing the thing you don't want to do becomes a habit and your habits create life.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday🎯</p>
    <p>This weeks theme: ‘Nothing happens on accident’</p>
    <p>The Kobes, Donald trumps, Kanye Wests, and Beethovens of the world didn’t just stumble upon greatness; there was a decision made to be great at something.
    </p>
    <p>After choosing what you want to do and be great at, there must be relentless action behind that; not perfect but relentless.</p>
    <p>This week go hard at something and know that you might not know how to do everything first but massive and relentless action trumps inaction every day.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday🙏</p>
    <p>This weeks theme: As long as you’re alive you can get better at skills🎯</p>
    <p>Things like public speaking, sales, planning, creativity, confidence, discipline aren’t something inherent to your being: It’s a skill. A skill that regardless of how good or bad you are can be learned and sharpened.</p>
    <p>The greatest things in life don’t come from comfort, they come from hard work and perseverance.</p>
    <p>Go out this week and inch closer to a skill you’d like to pick up. One step at a time 👣.</p>

    <p>Happy Motivational Monday 🙌</p>
    <p>Theme of the week: Clarity + Relentlessness🎯</p>
    <p>The physical world we live in is a direct reflection of our inner world. When you have clarity and mix that with relentless action, the world starts to reconfigure itself around your intentions. Without clarity, you can drift along not going anywhere and without action dreams remain as dreams. Focus on knowing what you want and then don’t stop until you get it. Have a blessed week guys and remember everything is out there for the taking for those who decide to.</p>

    <p>Theme of the week: There’s no fruits from the labor you didn’t put in🎯</p>
    <p>Going to keep this week light and simple. There’s no replacement for work. Cutting corners and avoiding the task necessary to win - often mundane, stressful and grueling - won’t yield the results we search for in life be it money, relationships, God, or Family.</p>

    <p>Theme of the week: Do that hard thing🎯</p>
    <p>‘Every adversity, every failure. Every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit’ - Napoleon Hill
    </p>
    <p>We naturally are hard wired to lean into comfort which is okay for when we were cavemen running away from animals trying to kill us. However, as 21st century humans, leaning into fears, pain, and facing it allows us to expand and become our best versions of ourselves. Use failure and hard work as a way to climb higher in your journey.</p>
